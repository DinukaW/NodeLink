# Chord-DHT-file-sharing-system
Distributed Hash Table based File Sharing System using Chord protocol  Background Chord is a distributed lookup protocol that can be used for peer-to-peer (p2p) file sharing. Chord distributes objects over a dynamic network of nodes, and implements a protocol for finding these objects once they have been placed in the network. Data location is implemented on top of Chord by associating a key with each data item, and storing the key/data item pair at the node to which the key maps. Every node in this network is a server capable of looking up keys for client applications, but also participates as key store. Moreover, chord adapts efficiently as nodes join and leave the system, and can answer queries even if the system is continuously changing. Hence, Chord is a decentralized system in which no particular node is necessarily a performance bottleneck or a single point of failure.
