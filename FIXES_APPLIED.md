# FIXED Chord DHT System - Quick Start Guide

## Issues Fixed:
1. ✅ Node shutdown hanging - Fixed infinite loops in threading
2. ✅ Empty successor/predecessor tuples - Fixed message handling
3. ✅ File operations hanging - Added proper timeouts and error handling
4. ✅ File path issues in put command - Fixed file path resolution
5. ✅ Bootstrap server port consistency - Now uses port 9000 everywhere

## Quick Start (Terminal Commands):

### Step 1: Setup test files
```bash
python3 setup_test_files.py
```

### Step 2: Start Bootstrap Server (Terminal 1)
```bash
python3 bootstrap_server.py
# Should show: Bootstrap server started on localhost:9000
```

### Step 3: Start Nodes (Separate Terminals)

**Terminal 2:**
```bash
python3 chord_cli.py localhost 8001
```

**Terminal 3:**
```bash
python3 chord_cli.py localhost 8002
```

**Terminal 4:**
```bash
python3 chord_cli.py localhost 8003
```

### Step 4: Test File Operations

In any node terminal:
```bash
# Put a file
[localhost:8001]> put test1.txt

# Get a file from another node
[localhost:8002]> get test1.txt

# Check status
[localhost:8001]> status

# Leave gracefully (should not hang now)
[localhost:8003]> leave

# Quit (should exit cleanly)
[localhost:8003]> quit
```

### Step 5: Monitor Network in Bootstrap Server

In bootstrap server terminal:
```bash
> status
```

## Key Improvements Made:

### 1. Threading Fixes
- Fixed infinite loops in `pinging()` method
- Added proper stop conditions for all threads
- Used daemon threads where appropriate

### 2. Socket Handling
- Added timeouts to prevent hanging
- Better error handling and connection cleanup
- Fixed socket reuse issues

### 3. File Path Resolution  
- Fixed `put` command to use correct file paths
- Now looks for files in `localhost_XXXX/` directories

### 4. Bootstrap Communication
- Consistent port usage (9000)
- Better error messages
- Timeout handling for bootstrap server communication

### 5. Graceful Shutdown
- Nodes now exit cleanly with `quit` command
- Proper cleanup of all resources
- No hanging threads

## Testing Checklist:

- [ ] Bootstrap server starts and shows status
- [ ] Nodes can join network without errors
- [ ] File put/get operations work
- [ ] Node status shows correct successor/predecessor
- [ ] Nodes can leave gracefully without hanging
- [ ] Network continues functioning after node leaves
- [ ] Bootstrap server tracks all changes correctly

## Troubleshooting:

If issues persist:
1. Ensure bootstrap server is running first
2. Check all nodes are using unique ports
3. Verify test files exist in correct directories
4. Use `status` command to debug network state
5. Check bootstrap server `status` for network overview
